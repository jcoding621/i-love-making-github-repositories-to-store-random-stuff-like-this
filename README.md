WHAT'S UP GAMERS my name is jcoding621 (that's not actually my name pls only call me that on github) AAAAAAAAAAAAND WELCOME BACK TO ANOTHER EPIC EPISODE OF ME CODING STUFF WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I'M DOING!!!!

This is my second ever project in HTML/CSS (my first one was kind of just a meme tho) and it's in the form of a website that serves as a market for cat products! (Products not included.) My inspiration for this project? Uhhhhh I like cats meow meow purr purr.

My coding specialties include: none. Uhhh I mean- I specialize in spamming the hell out of random new commands/features I find until my projects look like a 11 year old made them, needlessly prioritizing my aesthetics over functionality to the point of being too afraid to innovate the site, and of course, catlike laziness! I didn't even want to get out of bed this morning, like ever! I'd rather just sleep for eternity, but circadian rhythms have to exist, so I'm here to code impractical things for the world to see!
(someone please help me. i have not wanted to wake up for over a month and have been severely depressed even longer. i know this bracketed part seems like a meme post but it really isn't, this is actually a cry for help. don't worry i'm getting therapy and antidepressants and stuff but my life is genuinely so draining and painful lately please just help me live like a normal person)

I think that's it for now, if you enjoyed this epic README file then make sure to SMASH that follow button for periodic (once in a blue moon) updates on me absolutely destroying my website with idiocy!!!! I hope you enjoy seeing wherever this site goes!
